# Machine-Learning-Project1

Project 1 of the Machine Learning course at EPFL, Fall 2017.

Authors: Magnus Lysholm Lian, Jørgen Frost Bø and Serdar Taskafa

The file "Machine-Learning-Project1" is divided into 5 sub files. These are

1. HelpMethods
    Includes two files, helpers.py and given.py. Helpers includes all the helper methods needed to run our
    implementations and tests. Given includes the methods which was given along with the project.
2. Implementations
    Includes implementations.py, which has all the six machine learning methods we were asked to implement.
    The methods calls different helper methods, which are located in HelpMethods, helpers.py.
3. Plots
    Includes 4 files: features_vs_features_plot.py, feature_box_plot.py, least_squares_degree_plot.py and
    ridge_lambda_plot.py. The last two were used to produce the plots you can see in the report. The first two files
    were used for exploring the data set.
4. Run
    Includes the run.py file.
5. Tests
    Includes 2 files showing examples of how we used cross validation and split data to search for optimal
    hyper-paramters. The folder includes test_using_cross_validation.py and test_using_split_data.py
